# First Home Buyer's Guide to Financing Your Property Purchase in New Zealand

Entering the property market as a first home buyer in New Zealand can feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to understanding your financing options. As a licensed real estate agent with years of experience helping clients navigate the property buying process, I'll break down everything you need to know about financing your first home purchase.

## Understanding Your Financing Options

### Traditional Mortgages

The most common way to finance a property purchase is through a traditional mortgage:

**Key Features:**

### Low Deposit Options

For buyers with smaller deposits, several options exist:

**Family Guarantor Loans:**

- Parents or family members guarantee part of the loan
- Allows borrowing up to 100% of the property value
- Guarantor assumes responsibility if you default

**Government Schemes:**

- **KiwiSaver HomeStart Grant**: Up to $10,000 for existing homes, up to $20,000 for new builds
