# Retirement Planning for New Zealand Property Owners

As New Zealanders approach retirement, property ownership often represents their most significant asset. Properly leveraging this asset for retirement planning can provide financial security and peace of mind. As a licensed real estate agent who has helped numerous clients plan for retirement, I'll guide you through the essential strategies for using property wealth to secure your financial future.
