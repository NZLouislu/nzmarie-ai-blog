# Investing in New Zealand Property: A Guide for Australian Expats

For Australian expats living in New Zealand, investing in property can be an excellent way to build wealth and secure your financial future. However, the investment landscape comes with unique rules and considerations for non-residents. As a licensed real estate agent with extensive experience working with Australian expats, I'll guide you through the essential aspects of property investment in New Zealand.
